# Network overview
The infrastructure consists of two servers, one load balancer, and one database.
The load balancer distributes user requests between the two servers based on a weighted scheduling algorithm.
The load balancer enables an active-passive setup, where both nodes (servers) run simultaneously.
Master-slave replication enables data from one database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more other database servers (the slaves).
The replica node is on another node from the primary that ensures access to data in the event of a primary node failure.

# Issues
Without a firewall in the infrastructure, all unwanted IP addresses can access the resources.
No HTTPS means that the data usersâ€™ access is not encrypted, and in case of phishing, their content can be read by attackers in case of an attack.
Without monitoring, the server and client errors cannot be identified and hence cannot take appropriate measures.
